## A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME
My name is Sajeel Ahmad, and I live in Pakistan, GMT+05 Time Zone. I started to learn programming in the August 2018, the first language (so called) I learned was HTML.Then I started learning Python because I was interested in going into the Robotics Field. Fortunately, I couldn't make it to the Robotics Field, rather I got admission in Software Engineering. Currently, I am in 5th Semester of it, and have learned a lot since August 2018. 

Today, I am doing front end development and back end Development. In short you can call me a full stack developer at a learning stage.

3. React Native
4. GraphQL

**Databases**
